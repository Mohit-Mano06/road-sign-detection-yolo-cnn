## CNN Traffic Sign Classification

This module trains a CNN model for traffic sign classification using a
folder-based dataset structure. Each subfolder represents a numeric
class ID (0–4). Labels are automatically inferred during training.
A CSV file maps class IDs to human-readable traffic sign names.

Components:
- model.ipynb: CNN training notebook
- images_custom/: training images grouped by class ID [Not uploaded due to size limits]
- traffic_sign_custom.csv: label-to-name mapping
